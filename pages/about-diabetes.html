            <p id="desc">Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose is too high. It affects around 8.5% of the population and is one of the most researched diseases. Your pancreas makes insulin which helps your body convert the glucose from your food into energy for you to use, but when not enough insulin is being produced, the glucose stays in your blood and doesnâ€™t reach your cells.</p>

                <h2>Type 1 Diabetes</h2>
                <p> Diabetes type 1 is a genetic condition and often appears during childhood or adolescence. This means that lifestyle choices do not affect the risk of developing type 1 diabetes, but the only treatment is to take insulin to control your blood glucose levels, to test your blood glucose levels regularly, and to count your carbohydrate intake. </p>

                <h2>Type 2 Diabetes</h2>
                <p> Diabetes type 2 shares some similarities with type 1, but also has a few key differences. Type 2 diabetes occurs when your body begins to build a tolerance towards the insulin produced to convert the glucose and gradually loses the capacity to produce insulin. In contrast to type 1, type 2 diabetes can be significantly slowed or halted through healthy lifestyle choices such as exercise and diet changes. Type 2 diabetes consists of 85-90% of all diabetes cases. </p>
