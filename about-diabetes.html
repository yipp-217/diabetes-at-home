                <h2>Type 1</h2>
                <p> Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system is activated to destroy the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. 
                    We do not know what causes this autoimmune response. type 1 diabetes is not associated with modifiable lifestyle factors. 
                     It is one of the most common chronic childhood diseases. 
                    The onset is usually sudden, and symptoms are obvious and include excessive thirst and urination, unexplained weight loss, weakness and fatigue, and blurred vision. </p>

                <h2>Type 2</h2>
                <p> Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which the body becomes resistant to the normal action of insulin. There are strong genetic and family-related risk factors, and it is often associated with modifiable lifestyle risk factors, but we do not know the exact genetic cause of type 2 diabetes. 
                    There is, however, an opportunity for people to significantly slow or even stop the progression of the disease by changing their diet and increasing their physical activity. </p>
